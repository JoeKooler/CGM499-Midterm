A simple guessing number game made in 2 days for the multiplayer midterm project that you'll have to guess a random number against other player in the server if you can correctly guess you'll earned one point
There is no end for this game so whoever made it to the top of the scoreboard is technically the best player in the server at the moment...

# How to start?

1.Download the game 

2.Open the project in Unity (Sorry for not building the game ... i'll probably upload the build version soon)

3.Build the game

4.use ```node Assets/API/index.js``` in the command line (Again sorry for not building the exec for the server as well) (*You must have NodeJS and MongoDB to run the project)


# The stacks
